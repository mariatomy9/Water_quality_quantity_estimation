# Water_quality_quantity_estimation
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ,this is my first major project on Machine Learning.

This projects focuses on solving issues of unsafe drinking water and water shortage in rural villages of India. As part of this project I have selected 3 villages- Kottukal, Piripincode and Edukkode, collecting pH samples and water level in different spots of the villages at different times.

Results showed that most of the rural areas consume unsafe drinking water without even being aware of it. Several factors such as use of fertilisers, chemicals, factory wastes etc. have not only contaminated water but only had reduced the water level as well.

It's important that rural areas need to be developed ensuring that basic necessites of lives are fulfilled.
