According to WHO report 21% of the total diseases are caused by unsafe water and 77 Million people are suffering due to not having access to safe drinking water. This data clearly raises an alarm on this issue.
Water borne disease continues to occur and is one of the key concerns in developing countries.
In India 3.4 million people, mostly children, die annually from water-related diseases. About 2.2 million people die from diarrhea. 90% of these deaths are among children, mostly in developing countries. More than 1 billion people draw their water from unsafe sources. The UN has included “Safe Drinking Water” for everyone in Sustainability Development Goals 2030.
People especially living in rural areas are not even aware what the quality of the water they are consuming.
An interdisciplinary approach is required for providing best water quality measurement system. The quality of water is detected by considering physical, biological and chemical characteristics. Today’s system to detect quality of water, especially for chemical and biological contamination, requires access to lab equipment and sometimes takes 2–3 days. Villagers don’t have access to data about common water quality parameters such as chemical contamination (e.g. amount of Chlorine, pH value) and biological contamination (e.g. e- Coli bacteria etc.) in real time. In order to ensure the safe supply of the drinking water the quality needs to be monitor in real time.
As an innovative solution we bring you the Water Level And Quality Management System based on Internet of things.
Project overview:
Water level detection using ultrasonic sensors.
Quality detection using pH sensor.
Machine Learning model to map the places vulnerable to poor water quality

Project Description:
In this project,ultrasonic sensors are used to measure the water level in any water body.The pH sensor measures the pH of the water.These sensor values are processed by the arduino uno micro-controller and these are shown in the LCD display.
These values are used to train a machine learning model to classify areas which have water shortage and poor water quality.
ADVANTAGES:
Due to automation it will reduce the time to check the parameters.
This is economically affordable for common people.
Low maintenance.
Prevention of water diseases.
Future Scopes:
To give information to whole users those are depends on that plant
Detecting more parameters considering the water quality
Increase the parameters being measured by addition of multiple sensors.
To develop a web application /mobile app for directly determining the water quality.
